# paleomat: Application of the Modern Analog Technique for Paleoclimate Reconstruction

`paleomat` is an *R* package implementing functions to perform
temporal paleoclimate reconstruction from pollen using the
MAT (Modern Analog Technique).

This is the official R package for [paleomat](https://github.com/Archaeo-Programmer/paleomat), 
which contains all code associated with the analyses described and presented, including figures and tables, in Gillreath-Brown et al. 2022 (submitted): 

Gillreath-Brown, A., R. K. Bocinsky, and T. A. Kohler (2022). A Low-Frequency Summer Temperature Reconstruction for the United 
    States Southwest, 3000 BC â€“ AD 2000. Submitted to *The Holocene*.

## Installation

You can install paleomat from GitHub with these lines of R code (Windows users are recommended to install a separate program, Rtools, before proceeding with this step):

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Archaeo-Programmer/paleomat")
```

## Repository contents

The [:file\_folder: vignettes](vignettes) directory contains:

  - [:page\_facing\_up: UUSS_MAT_Reconstruction](vignettes/UUSS_MAT_Reconstruction.Rmd): R
    Markdown document for the entire analyses.
  - [:page\_facing\_up: Paleomat Figures](vignettes/Paleomat Figures.Rmd): R
    Markdown document that includes code to
    reproduce the figures and tables generated by the analysis. It also
    has a rendered version, `p3k14c.docx`.
  - [:file\_folder: figures](vignettes/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations, including supplemental
