Description: This R package repository is to accompany the submission for Gillreath-Brown et al. 2022, which preforms paleoclimate 
    (i.e., temperature) reconstruction from pollen data using the modern analog technique (MAT). This package contains all code 
    associated with the analyses described and presented, including figures and tables, in Gillreath-Brown et al. 2022 (submitted): 
    Gillreath-Brown, A., R. K. Bocinsky, and T. A. Kohler (2022). A Low-Frequency Summer Temperature Reconstruction for the United 
    States Southwest, 3000 BC â€“ AD 2000. Submitted to *The Holocene*.
